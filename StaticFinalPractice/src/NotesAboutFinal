Final is just like a constant.
Final is used in 3 places,

1. Final Variable --> {
These variables are constants.
Final variables can't be modified.
The convention of writing final variables are to capitalize the name of the variable.
There are 3 ways of initializing final variables --> {
    1. Initialize them when declaring.
    2. Initialize them inside instance block. i.e { initialize here }
    3. Initialize them inside the constructor of the class.
 }
}

2. Final Method --> {
Final methods can not be overrided.
We can inherit/extends a class which has a final method inside that class, but we can't override that final method.
}

3. Final Class --> {
A final class can't be extended/inherited.
We can create objects of the final class but we can not extend it to another class.
}
